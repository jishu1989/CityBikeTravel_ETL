# HSL CityBike Travel  

### Description:  

City bike stationsâ€™ Origin-Destination (OD) data includes all trips made with city bikes of Helsinki and Espoo. The data includes information about tripâ€™s origin and destination stations, start and end times, distance (in metres) as well as duration (in seconds). In this project we design a microservice to scrape data from hsl weblink, process the data, and create a snowflake pipeline to load data in the cloud database. 


### Data Source:

https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/helsingin-ja-espoon-kaupunkipyorilla-ajatut-matkat

Monthly data: "dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-[year]/[year]-[mm].csv" 

Yearly data: "dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-[year]/od-trips-[year].zip" 

### Scraping:  

We start by scraping the yearly data using the link to download yearly data. A zip file gets downloaded, which contains yearly data of city bike travel by month.


### Processing:  

Integrating the monthly datasets, to create a yearly dataset.


### Snowflake Load:  

Create a schema in the database, and staging table for yearly load => pushing data => to the database.
